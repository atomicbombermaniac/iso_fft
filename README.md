# iso_fft
FFT audio visualization using SDL2 ISO graphics via pulseaudio and kiss_fft.
Getting audio through pa_simple_read() (https://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/pulseaudio/doxygen/parec-simple_8c-example.html).
Processing using kiss_fft (https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft).
Rendering the results in isometric form, thanks to this tutorial https://medium.com/@fredhii/rising-the-ground-64957937513b .

This was made for fun. Feel free to change anything and use in any legal way.
Sorry for the garbage code.
